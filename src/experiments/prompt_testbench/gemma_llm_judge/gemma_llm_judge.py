Assessment Steps:
1. Assign between one and three policy "category" to the "response" array. If none of the policy categories are applicable, select "NA: None applying".
2. Provide a "confidence" for each "category" that represents how likely this category is in your opinion. All "confidence" values must sum up to 100. You must not explain your decision.
To provide your assessment use the following json template and stop directly after the closing bracket:
{
    "response": [{
        "category": str<"O1: Hate, Humiliation, Harassment"|"O2: Violence, Harm, or Cruelty"|"O3: Sexual Content"|"O4: Nudity Content"|"O5: Criminal Planning"|"O6: Weapons or Substance Abuse"|"O7: Self-Harm"|"O8: Animal Cruelty"|"O9: Disasters or Emergencies"|"NA: None applying">,
        "confidence": number,
    }]
